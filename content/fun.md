### :microphone: singing 

I love singing. It grounds me. Brings me joy. 
I would love to perform more, so  open to any and all opportunities to get on stage, including karaoke! 

Here's my lil' [singing account](https://www.instagram.com/esin.sings/?locale=es_ES) and my [Rehab by Amy Winehouse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIgMi3gKQfA) cover.

I am passionate about traveling and chronicling my travels on my instagram blog!

I used to compete in national tournaments, but not anymore...
